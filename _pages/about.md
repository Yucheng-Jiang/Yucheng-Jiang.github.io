I'm undergraduate student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying statistics and computer science. I won the Dean’s List Honorary designation for every semester since freshman. 

I'm a research assistant at [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) supervised by professor [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/). My primary research interests involve data mining, more specifically topic discovery and entity set expansion in the natural language processing field. Natural Language Processing arises in many contexts to facilitate tasks of analyzing large amounts of documents and understanding the context of natural languages. Besides, I’m also interested in computer vision and robotics.

# Research project

**Long-range Context Hierarchical Seed-Guided Topic Discovery**

- Research assistant, Data Mining Group, supervised by Prof. Jiawei Han (Aug. 2022 - Present)
- Lead a team of three students extend topic mining framework into hierarchy structure to facilitate hierarchical taxonomy construction and document classification
- Designed framework to leverage benefit of pre-train language model and retrieve topic implicative document segments to perform topic discovery in a broader context

**Entity Set Co-Expansion in StackOverflow**

- Research assistant, Data Mining Group, supervised by Prof. Jiawei Han (Aug. 2022 - Present)
- Design entity set expansion model to simultaneously expand multiple types of seed by using mutual exclusivity among entity sets to determine expansion boundary
- Leverage generic natural language knowledge from pre-train language model to facilitate learning seed representation based on themselves and their context simultaneously

**Seed-Guided Topic Mining**

- Research assistant, Data Mining Group, supervised by Prof. Jiawei Han (Nov. 2021 - Aug. 2022)
